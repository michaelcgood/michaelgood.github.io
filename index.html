<p> My name is Michael Good. </p>

<ul>I'm interested and experienced in:
  <li>Identity Access Management</li>
  <li>Security Architecture</li>
  <li> DevSecOps</li>
  <li>Solutions Architecture</li>
  <li>Vulnerability Assessments</li>
</ul>
<p>
I'm also currently working on my Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP), as I find penetration testing interesting.

I have worked for both the public and private sector.

If you would like to connect with me, please send me an email at michael@michaelcgood.com with any questions you may have.
