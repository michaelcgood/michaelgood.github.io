My name is Michael Good.

I'm interested and experienced in:
1. Identity Access Management
2. Security Architecture
3. DevSecOps
4. Solutions Architecture
5. Vulnerability Assessments

I'm also currently working on my Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP), as I find penetration testing interesting.

I have worked for both the public and private sector.

If you would like to connect with me, please send me an email at michael@michaelcgood.com with any questions you may have.
