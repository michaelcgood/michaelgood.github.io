This past week I quit my job that paid in the mid 100K range. It was a comfortable job where I got to learn new technologies and had a healthy relationship with my manager and colleagues. However, I sought to find meaning in spending time with family and trying to make the world a better place, so I decided to leave. Of course, I'm incredibly entitled that I can quit like that, since we have a bit of money saved up.
